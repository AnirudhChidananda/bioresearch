# Bioresearch Environment — Drug Discovery Lab

A biological reasoning environment for training and evaluating AI agents on real-world genomics and proteomics tasks. Designed for **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** compatibility and inspired by the [BioReason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14028) model series from Arc Institute.

This environment pairs **fast single-step tasks** with a **long-horizon, tool-calling "Drug Discovery Lab"** that trains frontier models to reason about disease mechanisms, aging biology, and druggable targets — and gives GRPO a dense per-step reward signal derived from gold `<think>` reasoning traces.

## Why this environment matters

**~7,000 rare diseases. ~350 million patients. ~95% with no FDA-approved therapy.** Every one of those gaps bottlenecks on the same human-expert workflow: read a variant brief, pull evidence from five-to-ten databases, reason toward a mechanism, and propose a concrete molecule. That loop is exactly where frontier LLMs systematically fail today — they answer single-turn QA well, but they can't run the 8-step lab.

**Aging is the upstream multiplier.** Cancer, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, type-2 diabetes — the biggest killers all scale with biological age. An agent that can chain `get_interpro` → `get_ppi` → `get_go` → `get_pathway` → `get_candidate_ligands` is an agent that can compress a year of postdoc bench-time into a coffee break, across thousands of senescence and longevity targets in parallel.

**The 22nd-century bet.** If we want our generation to live to the 22nd century, we have to industrialise the mutation→mechanism→molecule loop. This environment is the trainable substrate for that bet: 14 tasks, 11 deterministic tools, dense per-step process rewards, and a phased state machine that ends in a real SMILES — not an abstract "inhibit X".

**Hackathon themes covered**:

- _World Modeling / Professional Tasks_ — full target→evidence→hypothesis→intervention loop.
- _Long-Horizon Planning & Instruction Following_ — 8–20 tool-call steps per episode.
- _Self-Improvement_ — curriculum self-play that progressively hides tool hints.

## Motivation

Understanding genetic variants and protein function is central to modern biomedical research and drug discovery. This environment evaluates whether AI agents can:

- **Classify** the pathogenic effects of DNA mutations using pathway and sequence context
- **Reason** through step-by-step biological mechanisms linking mutations to diseases
- **Predict** protein function, subcellular location, and Gene Ontology annotations from sequence data
- **Compare** and **eliminate** candidate diseases using structured evidence ranking
- **Operate** a multi-step lab workflow: pick a target, characterise it via tool calls, hypothesise a mechanism, and propose a therapeutic intervention

These are tasks that human experts routinely perform, making this a genuine real-world evaluation benchmark.

## Tasks

The 14 tasks are grouped into five narrative scenes that walk the agent up the biological abstraction stack (variant → protein → pathway / perturbation → clinical) and then into long-horizon, tool-calling labs.

### Scene 1 — Variant reasoning

#### Intentional nested-grader scaffolding

Two tasks deliberately share graders with richer downstream tasks — kept on purpose as curriculum anchors and ablation baselines, not pruned as duplicates:

- **`dna_classification` ⊂ `dna_reasoning`**. `grade_dna_reasoning` calls `grade_dna_classification` internally (~40% of its score). Classification is the only easy-difficulty task in the registry and anchors the GRPO curriculum floor — it lets reward curves start from a non-trivial baseline without requiring the agent to emit reasoning chains.
- **`perturbation_direction_qa` ⊂ `perturbation_benchmark`**. `grade_perturbation_benchmark` reuses `grade_perturbation_direction` per variant (25% each). The standalone task uses only the clean `pert_dir` pool (low variance, one of the three headline GRPO reward curves), whereas the benchmark mixes four files at 2 samples/variant for a noisier "are we good across the whole CRISPRi axis?" score.

### Task 1: DNA Mutation Disease Classification (Easy)

The agent receives a DNA mutation context (chromosome, pathway network, gene list, reference/variant sequences) and must identify the resulting disease. A classification task with ~26 possible diseases.

### Task 2: DNA Mutation Biological Reasoning (Medium)

Same input as Task 1, but the agent must also articulate the step-by-step biological mechanism (e.g., "PDE11A loss-of-function → elevated cAMP → PKA activation → cortisol overproduction → Cushing syndrome"). Reasoning is graded at the step level.

### Task 3: Evidence Ranking (Medium-Hard)

The agent receives the same mutation context plus 4 candidate diseases (1 correct, 3 distractors). It must rank candidates, explain why each wrong disease was eliminated, and provide supporting evidence for the selected disease.

### Task 4: Protein Function Hypothesis Generation (Hard)

Given a protein sequence, name, organism, and InterPro domain annotations, the agent predicts biological function, subcellular location, and Gene Ontology terms with supporting reasoning.

### Task 5: Drug Discovery Lab (Long-Horizon)

Three new tasks run inside a **phased state machine** that gives agents up to 20 steps to:

1. **TARGET** — read an opening brief (DNA mutation or protein) and pick a candidate gene/protein.
2. **CHARACTERIZE** — call tools (`get_interpro`, `get_ppi`, `get_go`, `get_sequence`, `get_subcellular_location`, `search_catalogue`, `get_pathway`) to pull evidence into a rolling **notebook**.
3. **HYPOTHESIZE** — reason from the notebook toward a mechanism that explains the phenotype.
4. **INTERVENE** — propose a druggable modality: `{"mode": "inhibit" | "activate" | "degrade" | ..., "target": "..."}`.
5. **SUBMIT** — receive a terminal reward blending answer accuracy, GO-term F1 (leaf level), intervention plausibility, tool efficiency, and reasoning-trace coherence. **Dense per-step rewards** come from step-wise similarity of the agent's reasoning to gold `<think>` traces.

Each step, the observation exposes a `phase`, `remaining_steps`, `notebook`, `tool_result`, and `available_tools` so the agent can plan deliberately without the conversation context exploding.

The per-step reward is the best **`difflib.SequenceMatcher`** ratio between the agent's latest `reasoning` and any unseen gold `<think>` step from `Protien_catalogue.json`. This gives GRPO a visible reward gradient within minutes rather than waiting for terminal rollouts.

The directional grader normalises agent output aggressively: `up`, `increase`, `+`, `yes` → `Increase`; `down`, `decrease`, `-`, `no` → `Decrease`; anything else → `Unknown` and is scored neutrally (0.33). The `perturbation_benchmark` grader is just `grade_perturbation_direction` run four times (one per variant: `pert_dir`, `pert_de`, `gse_pert`, `gse_gene`) and averaged with equal weights — the per-variant sub-scores are exposed in `metadata.score_breakdown.per_variant` for plotting.

#### `get_structure` tool

`target_discovery_lab`, `protein_hypothesis_lab`, `clinical_diagnosis_lab`, and `curriculum_self_play` can now call `get_structure(protein_id=...)` to fetch the AlphaFold `structure_path` plus a deterministic 16-character signature. Proteins loaded from `Protien_data_2.json` / `Protien_sft_reasoning_2.json` expose this field; older entries return `{"error": "not_in_catalogue"}` so the agent learns to gracefully fall back. This lets the final hypothesis quote a concrete structure id (e.g. `AF-A0A0B4K6E2-F1-model_v4.cif`) — tightening the "mutation → structure → molecule" storytelling beat without adding any heavy deps.

#### Drug Design Phase

`target_discovery_lab` and `protein_hypothesis_lab` now schedule a **DRUG_DESIGN** window between `INTERVENE` and `SUBMIT`. During this phase the agent can call `get_candidate_ligands(gene, k=5)` and `get_drug_properties(smiles)` to pick a concrete molecule. On submit, if the agent populates `predicted_ligand`, a blended ligand-match + drug-tool-efficiency addon (≤ 15% weight) is folded into the existing terminal reward — turning the previously abstract `{"mode":"inhibit","target":"X"}` output into a real SMILES with a measurable pIC50.

## GRPO Compatibility

This environment is designed for GRPO training loops:

- **Same-prompt replay**: `reset(task_id="dna_042")` always returns the identical observation
- **Deterministic grading**: Same (input, response) always produces the same reward (tools return deterministic data)
- **High reward variance**: Different quality responses yield meaningfully different scores
- **Process reward**: Tasks 2–4 weight reasoning quality at 40–70% of total score; lab tasks add per-step dense reward
- **Dense signal**: Continuous metrics (Jaccard, F1, leaf-F1, SequenceMatcher) — no binary pass/fail

## Headline GRPO results

We GRPO-fine-tuned **Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct** with Unsloth 4-bit + TRL on a free Colab T4 against the live OpenEnv server (~150 steps, ~45 minutes wall-clock). Three reward curves are tracked side-by-side in the notebook and on the live Trackio dashboard:

| Reward curve | Why it's there |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| `protein_hypothesis_lab` | Long-horizon, dense per-step `<think>`-trace process reward — the headline curve |
| `perturbation_qa` | Batched binary CRISPRi world-modeling, sharpest single-turn signal |
| `perturbation_direction_qa` | 3-class directional CRISPRi (`Increase` / `Decrease` / `Unknown`) — extra label entropy = sharper GRPO advantage per step |
